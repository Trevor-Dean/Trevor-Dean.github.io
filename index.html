    <h2>My Personal Story</h2>
    <p>Hello my Name is Trevor Dean. Currently I am a second year computer science major here At UVU. This however was not always the case. 
        I started my schooling at the University of Utah in their Materials Science program and was stuying to be a Metallurgical Engineer.</p>
        
    <p>I went to the U for two semesters and took many of my general courses and major specific courses. It was at this point that two important events happened
         I took an internship with a mining company and I got engaged to be married to the wonderful girl shown in my picture up above.</p>
    
    <p>My internship was great and I enjoyed my co-workers immensely but I realised the two options I had for a career would be to either work in a mine which normally
        are in the middle of nowhere which would be hard for my soon to be family or work in a lab which I didn't really want to do. After considering my options I decided to change majors 
    and learn computer science so that I could have a similar experience to being an engineer but be able to work in better locations.
